# HTML to SolidJSX

This is the source code of the [HTML to Solid JSX](https://solidjs-community.github.io/html-to-solidjsx) website.

## Purpose

Existing HTML to JSX online transformers aren't compatible for SolidJS, it transforms to JSX that is suited for React templates.

1. Replaces standard HTML attributes such as `class` and `for` to `className` and `htmlFor`.
2. Incorrectly changes css variables names inside style attribute.

Solid attempts to stay as close to HTML standards as possible, allowing copy and paste from answers on Stack Overflow or from template builders from your designers. This [site](https://solidjs-community.github.io/html-to-solidjsx) brings that goal even closer by converting void elements(`<br>`) to self-closing(`<br/>`), while also providing customizations such as the option to camelCase attributes or having style attribute value set as a CSS object or string.
